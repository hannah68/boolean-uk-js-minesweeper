# minesweeper 

## Description 
Today we're building a simplified version of the popular Minesweeper game. All user interaction should be done through the prompt, so you'll be focusing on the logic 

## Instructions 
- Create a board with 10 spaces in it 
- Add a mine to one of these spaces 
- Ask the user to enter an index for the board 
- They will keep entering indices until they either hit a mine and lose, or clear all the empty spaces and win 
- When the game ends, let them know the outcome, including how many spaces they managed to clear before losing/winning Challenge Allow the user to pick a difficulty at the start of the game For example, they can choose between "easy", "normal" and "hard" Depending on the difficulty, add more or fewer mines to the board Note The instructions are purposefully open-ended. You get to choose what you think the best way is to create the board. Just aim to get the app to work as described. 

## Tips 
- Building a game requires you to keep track of information in a data structure, usually named state 
- Think about how can you repeatedly ask users for input until a condition is met? Challenge If you have time, a good idea is to evaluate your options. For example, try to think about different ways you could represent a board, and explore whether they make it easier to manage it all.
